# Standard library for Spawn programing language

This repository is an archived version of the stdlib
for [Spawn](https://github.com/i582/spawn-spec/tree/master), released for
history as an example of real Spawn code. Spawn is a toy language created by
combining ideas from Go and Rust.

It contains quite a lot of code (~70k LOC) for various purposes with varying
degrees of readiness.
